# ghp-paper-creds

This repository contains code samples for creating
[Good Health Pass](https://www.goodhealthpass.org/) paper credentials.

This is all based on the [GHP Blueprint](https://www.goodhealthpass.org/blueprint)
but we're attempting to keep this as technical and to the point as posisble.

If you're an implementer, your starting point should be 
the [Cookbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11n-lT57RQpYez_fAb_IHtL3D7h0VQ-inLTkvUJbSXn4/)
which will explain in more detail how to use this repo.

If you're more of a "dive right in" person, the [examples](examples/) folder
has example of various credential types, and [demo](demo/src/) has the code to 
create credentials youself.
